###  In a world landscape that is changing at a rapid pace, the advancement of technology and shift in global values has led to the rise of a wide array of threats. **The unmanned aerial system (UAS) threat has proliferated around the globe.** Aside from most major militaries rapidly adopting and developing unmanned technologies, it is alarming that *anyone* can go into a store buy a drone and retrofit it with a bomb or other weapon and fly it to any area.

[Epirus, Inc.](https://www.epirusinc.com) is effective in their approach to combat these threats. Much like the Greek hero *Theseus*, wielder of the  *The Epirus*, a bow with infinite arrows; they strive to be fast, efficient, and agile with limitless innovation. They are a tech company that has been developing software-defined directed energy systems. These systems have power management solutions, as well as electronic countermeasures, such as their Leonidas High Powered Microwave system (HPM) for vehicular, robotic and alien technologies.

The high-growth tech startup was founded in 2018 by Bo Marr, Grant L. Verstandig, Joe Lonsdale, John Tenet, Max Mednik,and Nathan Mintz. They set out to and, in competition with Boeing and other companies, create systems to sell to the US Military, that help land borne personnel and civilians survive drone swarms. As we have seen on many videos that can be found throughout the internet, even "over-the-counter" drones are a menacing threat and it is difficult to neutralize even just one, let alone three. In the future it is expected that we can see drone swarms of up to 30 units.

Boeing, and Raytheon have both developed their Counter-UAS system to be sold to US Miltary and Law Enforecement. Boeing's is a 300-kilowat laser to target missiles and aircraft, and Raytheon's is a small unit to be put onto drones themselves.


The Leonidas system is their flagship ground based counter electronic system. It utilizes High Powered Microwave directed energy combined with AI targeting and power mangement to fry the electronics of opposing drones and drone swarms. The AI power management utility within Leonidas, known as [Espirus SmartPower](https://www.epirusinc.com/power-management) (ESP), allows the unit to be **considerably smaller, more modular and more mobile than other Counter-UAS systems in the market.** They have also teamed up with defense sector giant General Dynamics to create the Strykyr Leonidas, which has retrofitted the Strykyr Mobile Troop Transport to house the Leonidas Unit.
