## Overview & Origin
* The Department of Defense (DoD) has been utilzing data- and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems for over 60 years. By equipping the United States and her military with these tools and resources to make its peacekeeping and warfighting capabilities more effective, will only increase the efficiency the DoD does business.  While the United States does possess capabilities that our competitors do not, the 2022 National Defense Strategy describes the need for the **US to strengthen deterrence to the People's Republic of China, which have communicated their intent to field AI for military advantage.**

* We're at war, whether or not we would like to admit it; for we are opposed today, a ruthless and monolithic conspiracy which relies on covert means, instead of outright invasion. The scale of which the DoD must operate is formidable. Luckily for us, there are entities out there that are more than willing to meet the challenge.

* **Epirus, Inc.** is effective in their approach. Much like the Greek Hero *Theseus* wielder of the  *The Epirus*, a bow with infinite arrows; Epirus, Inc. strives to be fast, efficient, and agile with limitless innovation.
