## Shotgun Line
###  **We're at war**, whether or not we would like to admit it. For we are opposed today, by a ruthless and monolithic conspiracy which relies on covert means, instead of outright invasion. The scale of which the DoD must operate is formidable. Luckily for us, there are entities out there that are more than willing to meet the challenge.

## Overview & Origin
* **The Department of Defense (DoD)** has been utilzing data- and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems for over 60 years. By equipping the United States and her military with these tools and resources to make its peacekeeping and warfighting capabilities more effective, will only increase the efficiency the DoD does business.  While the United States does possess capabilities that our competitors do not. The 2022 National Defense Strategy describes the need for the **US to strengthen deterrence to the People's Republic of China, which intends to field AI for military advantage.**

* [Epirus, Inc.](https://www.epirusinc.com) is effective in their approach. Much like the Greek Hero *Theseus* wielder of the  *The Epirus*, a bow with infinite arrows; they strive to be fast, efficient, and agile with limitless innovation. They are a tech company that has set out to develop software-defined directed energy systems. These systems have power management solutions, as well as electronic countermeasures, such as their Leonidas High Powered Microwave system (HPM) for vehcicular, robotic and alien technologies.  

* The high-growth tech startup company was founded in 2018 by Bo Marr, Grant L. Verstandig, Joe Lonsdale, John Tenet, Max Mednik,and Nathan Mintz. They set out to create systems that help land borne personnel and civilians survive drone swarms. As we have seen on many videos that can be found throughout the internet, even "over-the-counter" drones are a menacing threat and it is difficult to neutralize even just one let alone three. In the future it is expected that we can see drone swarms of up to 30 units.

* Epirus' Tech has gained considerable investments too. In 2022 they landed a $200M Class C deal and closed with post-deal valuation of $1.35B that includes investors T. Rowe Price Associates, 8VC and Bedrock.
