### The Department of Defense (DoD) has been utilzing data- and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems for over 60 years. Equipping the United States and its military with these tools and resources to make its peacekeeping and warfighting capabilities more effective, will only increase the efficiency the DoD does business.  While the United States does possess capabilities that our competitors do not, the 2022 National Defense Strategy describes the need for the US to strengthen deterrence to the People's Republic of China, which have communicated their intent to field AI for military advantage.
