###  In a world landscape that is changing at a rapid pace, the advancement of technology and shift in global values has led to the rise of a wide array of threats. **The unmanned aerial system (UAS) threat has proliferated around the globe.** Aside from most major militaries rapidly adopting and developing unmanned technologies, it is alarming that *anyone* can go into a store buy a drone and retrofit it with a bomb or other weapon and fly it to any area.

#### [Epirus, Inc.](https://www.epirusinc.com) is effective in their approach to combat these threats. Much like the Greek hero *Theseus*, wielder of the  *The Epirus*, a bow with infinite arrows; they strive to be fast, efficient, and agile with limitless innovation. They are a tech company that has been developing software-defined directed energy systems. These systems have power management solutions, as well as electronic countermeasures, such as their Leonidas High Powered Microwave system (HPM) for vehicular, robotic and alien technologies. 

The high-growth tech startup was founded in 2018 by Bo Marr, Grant L. Verstandig, Joe Lonsdale, John Tenet, Max Mednik,and Nathan Mintz. They set out to and, in competition with Boeing and other companies, create systems to sell to the US Military, that help land borne personnel and civilians survive drone swarms. As we have seen on many videos that can be found throughout the internet, even "over-the-counter" drones are a menacing threat and it is difficult to neutralize even just one, let alone three. In the future it is expected that we can see drone swarms of up to 30 units.

Boeing, and Raytheon have both developed their Ai assissted Counter-UAS system to be sold to US Miltary and Law Enforecement. Boeing's is a 300-kilowat laser to target missiles and aircraft, and Raytheon's is a small unit to be put onto drones themselves. Being laser wepons their range is exceptional, however they can't capture the same area-of-effect radius a microwave can.

**The Leonidas system is Epirus' flagship ground based counter-electronic system.** It utilizes High Powered Microwave directed energy combined with AI targeting -via computer vision- and power mangement to fry the electronics of opposing drones and drone swarms. The AI power management utility within Leonidas, known as [Epirus SmartPower](https://www.epirusinc.com/power-management) (ESP), allows the unit to be **considerably smaller, more modular and more mobile than other Counter-UAS systems in the market.** They have also teamed up with defense sector giant **General Dynamics** to create the Stryker Leonidas, which has retrofitted the Stryker Mobile Troop Transport to house the Leonidas Unit.

#### Continued Success for the Future

If Epirus was able to develop a maritime operation for the leonidas system they should be able to negotiate a deal with the NAVY, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard increasing profits and ensuring company success for the future. It shouldn't be difficult to achieve considering the modularity of the Leonidas System. Providing us with continued updates through videos of field tests will be sufficient to win over many potential customers.

Considering their trends since starting in 2018, It's without a doubt this company will continue to grow, and acheiving more venture capital from potential investors.

## The Finances 

#### With the major trend of militaries shifting towards autonomous technologies, Epirus' Tech has gained considerable investments.

 - In 2020 Epirus landed a [$70M Series B deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201217005156/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Epirus-Inc.-Raises-70M-in-Series-B-Funding-Advancing-Directed-Energy-For-Defense-and-Commercial-Applications) that include L3Harris Technologies. In 2022 they landed a [$200M Series C deal](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/exclusive-epirus-efforts-drone-zapping-weapons-get-boost-with-200-mln-cash-2022-02-15/#:~:text=Epirus%20raised%20%24200%20million%20in,other%20investors%2C%20the%20company%20said) that includes investors T. Rowe Price Associates, 8VC and Bedrock. and closed with post-deal valuation of $1.35B.

 - An estimated revenue of $67.3M and total funding of $287.4M

 “Under the extraordinary leadership of Leigh Madden, Bo Marr, and Ken Bedingfield, Epirus has achieved multiple milestones at breathtaking pace,” said Grant Verstandig, Epirus Co-Founder and Executive Chairman. “Now, with backing from an exceptional, high-conviction group of investors led by Bedrock and support from two of the defense sector’s most innovative and forward-thinking partners in L3Harris and Northrop Grumman, Epirus is poised to revolutionize directed energy and break the boundaries of power management, with far-reaching potential across defense, security, and commercial applications.” -businesswire.com-
